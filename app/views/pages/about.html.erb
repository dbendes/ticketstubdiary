<h1>About</h1>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I thought I'd take a page and talk about why I built Ticket Stub Diary.</p>
<p>I've always been a huge fan of live music. In 2014, I made a New Year's Resolution to see, on average, one concert per week. I saw more than sixty, and I collected a lot of ticket stubs. I had started attaching some to my whiteboard with magents, but the whiteboard quickly became unusable.</p>
<p>I didn't want to throw them out - each one carried a memory - but I needed a better way to keep track. I had my blog about my 52 Shows adventure, but I'm always up for building something new. That's when I had the idea for Ticket Stub Diary.</p>
<p>I've since built an app that lets me catalog all of the shows that I've seen and look at some interesting data points about my concert-going activities (I visited 20+ venues last year!). Since anything worth doing is worth doing right, I built it out with a full log-in system so other people can use it, too.</p>
<p>If you're a concert fanatic like me, hopefully it helps you keep track of the different shows you see. Thanks for checking it out!</p>
